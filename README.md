# Phonebook App
This phonebook app was created by following the FullStack Open course using JavaScript, React, NodeJS and MongoDB. The aim of this project was to better understand how a fullstack web application is developed, how different parts of the stack communicated with each other and also to exercise some JavaScript.

Commits are all over the place as I was not planning on uploading to GitHub. (usually I'm good with my commits, I promise! ðŸ˜…)
